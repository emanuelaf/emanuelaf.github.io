```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.align ='center', warning = FALSE, message = FALSE,
                      fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5)
```


## Annoying things to do with `ggplot2`

Beside the basic syntax there is a number of things that are bit tricky to do with `ggplot2`. By "tricky" I just mean a number of things that are not essential but that make your plots look much nicer and often take a long time to do.

### Customise axis font and size



### Customise title font and size



### Customise colours



### Customise legend



### Overlapping differerent datasets



### Setting axis scales



### Barplot with given bar length
