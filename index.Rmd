title: "My website"

I am a Post Doc Researcher in Social Statistics and Demography in Milan, and I am also a private consultant for predictive data analaysis, data visualisation and reporting. 

I like to see myself as a sort of _data detective_, where I use data to answer questions, to solve mysteries, to investigate pheonomena. In order to investigate and give the proofs of my findings, I mainly use `R`. I also like to teach _data detective_ skills, either to professionals or to students more or less interested -.-'.

As I do lots of teaching, also using `R`, as well as lots of data analysis with `R`, I decided to create this website in which I collect and share some projects, some code and some of my lessons, that I hope may be of use to others.

If you happen to be in Milan, you can find me every monday at [tango macao](https://facebook.com/macaotango/), where we can talk about data analysis and statistics in between tandas ;)
